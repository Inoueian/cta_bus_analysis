# cta_bus_analysis
Analysis of CTA bus data as collected by the Chi Hack Night's Ghost Buses breakout group. The backend repo is [here](https://github.com/chihacknight/chn-ghost-buses/tree/main).

Some research questions (to be updated as I go):
1. What are the frequencies for each bus route, for a given day of week and time of day?
2. How do these actual frequencies compare to the scheduled frequency?
3. Which bus routes tend to have the most bunching? (How do I quantify this? Standard deviation in the frequency/headway?)
